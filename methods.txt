#When creating two class 1)Consists of main() 2)Class which has other functional method ,
you need to compile both and run the class which has main() method in it .
Example: Refer to Method.java for code
"javac Calculator.java Method.java "
Run the Correct Class: Instead of running the Calculator class, run the Method class:
bash
"java Method"

# Method Overloading
is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows a class to
 have more than one method with the same name, provided that the methods have different
 parameter lists (different types, number of parameters, or both).
 This enables methods to perform similar functions but with different inputs,
 enhancing code readability and usability.

 EXAMPLE:

 public class MathOperations {

     // Method to add two integers
     public int add(int a, int b) {
         return a + b;
     }

     // Overloaded method to add three integers
     public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
         return a + b + c;
     }

     // Overloaded method to add two double values
     public double add(double a, double b) {
         return a + b;
     }

     public static void main(String[] args) {
         MathOperations math = new MathOperations();

         // Calling the different overloaded methods
         System.out.println("Sum of two integers: " + math.add(5, 10)); // Calls the first method
         System.out.println("Sum of three integers: " + math.add(5, 10, 15)); // Calls the second method
         System.out.println("Sum of two doubles: " + math.add(5.5, 10.5)); // Calls the third method
     }
 }

 # Every method has its own stack in jvm to give variables
   their spaces and values that have been assigned to them.
