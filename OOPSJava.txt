Class & Object

#new keyword in Java
The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. All objects get memory in Heap memory area.

# What is an object in Java
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible).
An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.

Object Definitions:
*An object is a real-world entity.
*An object is a runtime entity.
*The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
*The object is an instance of a class.


# What is a class in Java
A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
A class in Java can contain:
*Fields
*Methods
*Constructors
*Blocks
*Nested class and interface

#Syntax to declare a class:
class <class_name>{  
    field;  
    method;  
}  

#EXAMPLE OF JAVA PGM:
//Java Program to illustrate how to define a class and fields  
//Defining a Student class.  
class Student{  
 //defining fields  
 int id;                                        //field or data member or instance variable  
 String name;   
 public static void main(String args[]){        //creating main method inside the Student class  
  Student s1=new Student();                     //Creating an object or instance//creating an object of Student  
  System.out.println(s1.id);                   //Printing values of the object//accessing member through reference variable  
  System.out.println(s1.name);  
 }  
}  

#OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)
Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:
Object
Class
Inheritance  -refere to Inheritance.java file 
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation

Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:
Coupling
Cohesion
Association
Aggregation
Composition
