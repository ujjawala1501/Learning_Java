Greedy method is used for optimization problems:optemization probs are the ones who require max or min result.
p:A->B (there will be multiple solutions to reach from A to B like taking train or bus or walk...)
Feasible Solution : The solution which satisfies the requirement given to us like we need to reach in 2 hrs so well take a flight .
Minimization problem : the problem demans minimum solution.
Optimal problem : The  solution both feasible and minimal.
satisfying the objective of the problem.

#To solve optimizatio problem:
1.Greedy Method
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Branch and Bound

A problem should be solved in stages ,each time we pick a solution

Algorithm Greedy (a,n){
    for i=1 to n development
    {
        x=select(a);
        if feasible(x) then
        solution=solution+x;
    }
}



EXPLANATION:
Suppose if you want to buy best car(optimal car) .
you will figure YOUR best approach so that you doont have to look each car in the whole city .
and according to your selection process youll find the best car this is greedy method.
