package Package; //This is how it should be mentioned in all the files
//if a file is outside of package like other files here which are not part of "package" folder you have to mention "import foldername.class"
//example: 
import Inheritance.calc1 ;
//import java.util.ArrayList // java is a folder,util is a folder ,Arraylist is a class.
//all inbuild are in a package
//System is a class 
//Java.lang.System is by default imported hence System is not required to be imported.
// when big project is created or libraries are created the name of package which will be share with the world needs to have a unique name.
public class file1 {
    
}
