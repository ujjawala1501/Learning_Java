/*The Java Collections Framework provides a unified architecture for storing and manipulating groups of objects. It includes interfaces, implementations, and algorithms that facilitate various operations on collections.
Key Interfaces
Collection:
The root interface in the collection hierarchy.
Common methods:
int size(): Returns the number of elements.
boolean isEmpty(): Checks if the collection is empty.
boolean contains(Object element): Checks if an element exists.
boolean add(Object element): Adds an element (optional).
boolean remove(Object element): Removes an element (optional).
Iterator iterator(): Returns an iterator over the elements.

List:
An ordered collection that can contain duplicates.
Implementations include:
ArrayList: Resizable array implementation.
LinkedList: Doubly linked list implementation.
Set:
A collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
Implementations include:
HashSet: Uses a hash table for storage, offering constant time performance for basic operations.
TreeSet: Implements a red-black tree, maintaining sorted order.
Map:
A collection of key-value pairs where keys are unique.
Implementations include:
HashMap: Offers constant time performance for basic operations.
TreeMap: Maintains sorted order of keys.
Queue:
A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
Implementations include:
PriorityQueue: Orders elements based on their natural ordering or a comparator.
Important Classes
Collections: A utility class that provides static methods for common operations on collections (e.g., sorting, searching).
Arrays: Contains static methods for manipulating arrays (e.g., sorting).
